# WeatherTracker
This script uses the weather restrictions for bat acoutsic surveys per the USFWS Indiana Bat survey protocol and sends an email notification with the metric ranges and a `PASS` or `FAIL` status.

For more information on the USFWS protocol, see [here](https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/range-wide-indiana-bat-and-northern-long-eared-bat-survey-guidelines).
